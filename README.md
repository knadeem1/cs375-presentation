CS 375 Presentation 

Algorithms in this program are implemented using the C++ STL. Two approaches are used in solbing the maximum subarray problem: divide and conquer and dynamic programming.
Runtime complexities for these approaches are as follows:
Divide and Conquer: Theta(nlgn)
Dynamic Programming: O(n)
